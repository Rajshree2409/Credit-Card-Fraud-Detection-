This project focuses on developing a system for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The goal is to accurately identify potentially fraudulent transactions and minimize financial losses.

# Project Overview
Credit card fraud detection involves identifying suspicious transactions that deviate from normal spending patterns. This project utilizes various machine learning algorithms to classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent.

# Dataset
The project uses a publicly available dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains credit card transactions over a span of two days, with features that have been anonymized for confidentiality reasons.

# Data Preprocessing
Handling Imbalance:

The dataset is highly imbalanced, with the majority of transactions being legitimate.
Techniques like oversampling (e.g., SMOTE) or undersampling can be used to balance the dataset.
Normalization:

Features are scaled to have values between 0 and 1 to ensure that the model performs well.
Splitting Data:

The data is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
Model
Feature Engineering:

Creation of new features or modification of existing ones to improve model performance.
Algorithm Selection:

Various machine learning algorithms are tested, including:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forests
Gradient Boosting Machines
Neural Networks
Ensemble methods may also be used to combine the strengths of multiple algorithms.
Evaluation Metrics:

Due to the imbalance, metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (PR AUC) are preferred over accuracy.
Implementation
Training:

Models are trained on the preprocessed dataset.
Hyperparameter tuning is performed using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.
Testing:

The trained models are evaluated on the test set.
Cross-validation is used to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.
Deployment:

The best-performing model is saved and deployed for real-time prediction.
